d 'IETOOLKIT': module providing commands specially developed for Impact Evaluations
d 
d  ietookit provides a set of commands that address different
d aspects of data management and data analysis in relation to
d Impact Evaluations. The list of commands will be extended
d continuously, and suggestions on new commands are highly
d appreciated. Some of the commands are related to standardized
d practices developed at the World Bankâ€™s unit for Impact
d Evaluations (DIME) and might not apply to practices adopted at
d other institutions. For these commands, the corresponding help
d files provide justifications for the standardized practices
d applied. ieduplicates and iecompdup are useful tools to identify
d and correct for duplicates. iebaltab is a tool for multiple
d treatment arm balance tables. ieboilstart standardizes the
d boilerplate code at the top of all do-files. iegraph produces
d graphs based on common impact evaluation regression models. See
d https://github.com/worldbank/ietoolkit for more details.

d 'IEFIELDKIT': module providing Stata commands for primary data collection and cleaning
d 
d  iefieldkit provides a set of commands that enable a reproducible
d primary data collection and cleaning workflow. The package is
d developed to facilitate a workflow including (1) data collection
d (in particular using opendatakit.org, more specifically
d surveycto.com); (2) basic data cleaning, such as labeling and
d recoding; (3) reconciling survey rounds; (4) preparing codebooks
d to document data sets. iefieldkit was developed to standardize
d and simplify best practices for high-quality primary data
d collection across the World Bank's Development Research Group
d Impact Evaluations team (DIME). The commands can also be used
d independently, and are developed to be applicable to many other
d contexts as well. See https://github.com/worldbank/iefieldkit for
d more details.

d 'WINSOR': module to Winsorize a variable
d 
d winsor takes the non-missing values of a variable and generates a
d new variable  identical except that the h highest and h lowest
d values are replaced by the  next value counting inwards from the
d extremes. h can be specified directly or  indirectly by
d specifying a fraction p of the number of observations: h =  [p
d n]. This transformation is named after the biostatistician C.P.
d Winsor. This is version 1.3.0 of  the software.

d 
d  estout produces a table of regression results from one or

d word-processor table. eststo stores a quick copy of the active
d estimation results for later tabulation. esttab is a wrapper for
d estout. It displays a pretty looking publication-style regression
d table without much typing. estadd adds additional results to the
d e()-returns for one or several models previously fitted and
d stored. This package subsumes the previously circulated esto,
d esta, estadd,  and estadd_plus. An earlier version of estout is
d available  as estout1.

d 'GRC1LEG2': module to combine multiple graphs with a single common legend
d 
d    grc1leg2 is an enhanced version of Vince Wiggins' grc1leg.
d Like grc1leg, grc1leg2 is a wrapper for Stata's graph    combine,
d invoking its ability to array separate, previously drawn graphs
d as panels in a single combined graph.    By default, the
d characteristics of the common legend are inherited from the
d original version of the legend in the first  component graph,
d or in the graph specified by the option legendfrom(name).  With
d grc1leg2's legend options, the user can    precisely control the
d placement of the common legend within the combined graph.  Other
d legend options allow the user to    override some of the
d characteristics of the legend inherited from its original
d creation as part of one of the component    graphs.
